<h1>A ​Dagga Private Clubs​ (​DPC​) is a registered, non-profit  company formed by adult people who use Cannabis. A DPC  consists in the articulation of private spaces where registered  members collectively organize the safe & private cultivation of  Cannabis sativa​ L. for an amount exclusively meant for their  own personal use.</h1> <br>

<h1>DPCs are organized as Non-Profit Companies, characterised by  transparency, democracy, and non-profitability. </h1>  <br>
<h1>DPCs organize a general assembly at least once a year, where  annual reports are discussed. These reports include a complete  balance of income and expenses, as well as a quality assessment of  the crops and the products proposed for consumption. <br>
<h1>DPCs can hire staff members, who can receive reasonable  remuneration. Thus they contribute to the creation of decent and  sustainable employment, to economic dynamism, and the State can  regularly collect taxes on its wages. </h1>
<h1>DPC members pay membership fees which may be proportionate to  their consumption, used to cover the costs of production,  processing, storage, management, and wages. Any economic profit  or excedent is reinvested in the association, in particular social,  cultural, artistic or scientific activities, in the hiring of legal or  medical consultancy, or in the support to the civil society sector  promoting the legal regulation of Cannabis.</h1>
